Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of people worldwide, with early and accurate diagnosis being crucial for effective management. This project presents a novel approach to Parkinson's disease detection using Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The primary objective is to develop a robust and reliable diagnostic tool to assist healthcare professionals in early detection and intervention.

This project contributes to the field of medical diagnostics by offering a non-invasive and cost-effective solution for Parkinson's disease detection. The developed ML models can potentially assist healthcare professionals in making timely and informed decisions, ultimately improving the quality of life for individuals affected by this debilitating condition.

The success of this project underscores the potential of ML in revolutionizing healthcare, particularly in the early diagnosis and management of neurological disorders like Parkinson's disease.
