SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM) ALGORITHM

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression. 
Though we say regression problems as well itâ€™s best suited for classification. The main objective of the SVM algorithm 
is to find the optimal hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that can separate the data points in different classes in 
the feature space. The hyperplane tries that the margin between the closest points of different classes should be as 
maximum as possible. The dimension of the hyperplane depends upon the number of features. If the number of input features 
is two, then the hyperplane is just a line. If the number of input features is three, then the hyperplane becomes a 2-D plane.
